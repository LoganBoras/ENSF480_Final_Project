Movie Theatre Ticket Reservation App

Instructions for setup
----------------------
To run this application, you must set up the database in your mySQL workbench.
In your workbench, import the traDB.sql file that can be found in the Database package in the src directory.
For this application, we have set the database password to 'ENSF480TRA'.
If you do not wish to reset your mySQL password to match this, you must replace the password in the DatabaseManager.java file
in the initialize function to your own password.
Next you must add a mySQL connector jar file to your dependencies and in a library folder.
Once you have completed these steps, the application will be able to compile and run.
